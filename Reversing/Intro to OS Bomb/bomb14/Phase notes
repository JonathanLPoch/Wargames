Phase 1: Simple string comparison - 
Solution: The future will be better tomorrow.

Phase 2: Reads 6 integers into array. Loops through array and...
First num > 0
Next number = Prev num + (index+1). 1 + 1 = 2... 2 + 2 = 4... 4 + 3 = 7... 7 + 4 = 11... 11 + 5 = 16
Solution: 1 2 4 7 11 16

Phase 3: Reads 6 integers into array. Loops through array and...
First num = 1
Next number = Prev num * 2
Solution: 1 2 4 8 16 32

Phase 4: Reads 6 integers into array. Loops through array and...
First & second num = 1
ebx = arr[1]
eax = arr[2] + arr[1]
arr[3] = eax?
So
arr[x] = arr[x-1] + arr[x-2]

Phase 5: Reads 2 integers and performs recursion on first
First integer must be < 0xF
Second integer must be 27

Scripted the recursion
Solution: 9 27

Phase 6: Reads 6 integers into array. Loops through array and...
Makes sure all numbers are <= 6
Makes sure all numbers are unique (1-6)
Creates an array with preset values
Solution: 1 6 4 2 5 3

Secret Phase?: Requirements:
num_input_strings = 6 (must have completed all 6)
